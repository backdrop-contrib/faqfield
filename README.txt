  You can add the field to any entity (eg. content type, users, ..) as usual.
  After you applied the field you have to configure how its output should be
  filtered (eg. Filtered HTML, Plain Text). Also it is recommended to set the
  number of values to unlimited.

  You have the choise of two display formatters:
  - Accordion (jQuery JavaScript animated show / hide) [Default]
  - Simple text (none formatted, simple output for custom theming)
  If you are using accordion you can modify its behaviour easily by the display
  settings.
